<p class="dropcap">It was the custom of the Roman <i>Prætor Urbanus</i>
when entering upon his duties to post up in plain
view of the public a brief exposition of the principles
which were to guide him in passing judgment during
his year of office. It seems fit that the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span>
should likewise issue its own EDICTVM PERPETVVM
setting forth the scope and ultimate purpose
of such literary criticisms as may appear from
time to time in its pages.</p>

<p>It is offenders only who are to be deemed worthy
of Reviews in these columns and as the worst possible
offence of which they can be guilty, since it
includes all specific or lesser faults, is the bare fact
of their existence in type, it will be our aim to hold
up to the merited scorn of an outraged world the
responsible progenitors of such unblessed offspring,
the Publisher, and his partner in sin, the Author of
the book.</p>

<p>In thus reversing that order in criminality which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
has hitherto obtained in the assizes of criticism we
are moved by the consideration among others: the
writing of any book, good or bad, is a matter of concern
to its author alone so long as it remains in manuscript.
Its merits or demerits have alike no existence
to the public; however shameless its morals, feeble
its plot or intolerable its dullness these are all equally
powerless for mischief so long as it has not been put
into type and launched upon a much suffering, helpless
world. Then its career of evil begins. For this
the Publisher is solely responsible; he and he alone
is able to remedy the abuses which have long been
calling out to heaven for suppression, by setting up
some sort of standard as to the minimum of those
defects which shall bar any manuscript whatever
from his favorable consideration. What this minimum
ought to be we shall take pleasure in enlightening
him from time to time in these pages.</p>

<p>It may be urged that the weapon of scorn has been
used and abused time out of mind; we reply that the
objector is in error in one essential. The dart is an old
one indeed, but its point has been blunted, not in the
fattening tissues of this chief offender but on the
scantily clad bones of his weaker accomplice, the
much-abused author. In issuing an illegitimate book
the Author is the victim of the sweetest and most
pathetic fallacy known to men: <i>he believes his work is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
good</i>; while the publisher knows better. One is animated
by love and nature, the other has only a lust
for dollars. In such offenses as we are discussing,
no less than in certain others needing no more explicit
designation, it is not the deed itself but its exposure
which calls forth the protests of a PHILISTINE
public. Those Little Sisters in Sin, <i>A Superfluous
Woman</i> and <i>Bessie Costrell</i> might have faded
to oblivion in their swaddling clothes had no publisher
been found to expose them to daylight.</p>

<p>It will be understood therefore that our column of
Reviews exists, not to aid struggling authors or enterprising
publishers to launch their craft upon the
already crowded ocean of Literature, but as the Pillory
where manifest culprits are exposed to the jibes
of the crowd, to the end that others who are meditating
like deeds may be warned by such penalty to
desist. Nor need the idle stocks ever yawn in emptiness
so long as upon his right hand and his left a
man beholds such a richness of backs itching for the
lash.</p>

<p>And since we have promised that instruction shall
go hand in hand with castigation we will not
close until we have pointed out for the future guidance
of those who may wish to avoid one at least of
the many by-paths of reprobation, that in any novel
we regard the existence of page Four Hundred of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
readable type as confession on the part of both Publisher
and Author that neither of them has yet learned
the foremost and greatest of the arts of their trade—the
art to blot.</p>

<p><i>De confessis sicuti de manifestis—supplicium sumendum
est.</i></p>

<h3>A TRINITY OF OFFENDERS.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. THE LAND OF THE SUN, <i>a third rate
guide-book to Mexico, and incidentally a Touter for
one of its Railways</i>; by Christian Reid, a woman who
once wrote a good novel, superfluously illustrated,
12mo. cloth, pp. 355. D. Appleton &amp; Co., N. Y.,
$1.75.</p>

<p>2. LOVE IN IDLENESS, by F. Marion Crawford,
author of ETC., <i>etc.</i>, &amp; etc., absurdly illustrated,
crown 8vo., cloth, gilt-edge, pp. 218. Macmillan &amp;
Co., N. Y., $2.00.</p>

<p>3. ADVICE TO LITERARY ASPIRANTS—<i>One
Hundred Ways to Become Famous for One Dollar</i>,
by Mr. Arthur Lewis, illustrated, 12mo., pp. 247.
Dodd, Rott &amp; Co., N. Y., $1.00.</p>

</div>

<p>1. We are but too familiar, all of us, with the
devices of the quack-medicine advertiser, his trick of
getting us to read his puff in spite of ourselves. It is
an old yet still successful dodge. The first sentence in
a column of the morning paper promises a little ten
minute romance. As we proceed our interest quickens.
We inadvertently glance to the end to learn whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
the hero is destined to the rope or the heroine reserved
for the altar. There stands forth the mark of
the Beast, “<i>Butcher’s Bilious Bouncer</i>, sure cure for
the Liver, price ten cents.” According as nature
has allied us to Democritus or to Archilochus we
laugh or swear at our gullibility while we turn to
some other item, but if fair-minded men we do not
swear at the editor, for we know that he lives by letting
for hire his numberless columns with no restriction
on his advertisers save that their matter does not
exclude his paper from the United States Mail.</p>

<p>It is far different, however, when trusting in
an author’s name or at least in the imprint of a
publisher of high standing, a man takes up a book
which he has bought in the expectation of finding it
a readable or at all events a genuine novel, but soon
discovers it to be a string of sausages, whose thin
membrane of such romance as it does afford exists
merely to encase a solid stuffing of railroad advertisements,
“scenic route” business and such secondhand
truck. Yet of such is the <i>Land of the Sun</i>. Before
reading it myself I tendered it to a friend in
answer to his request for the latest novel. A few days
after, he returned it saying, “It opens more like an
advertisement of the Bullseye Parlor Car Company.”</p>

<p>Now it so happens that the people who made the
book are also publishers of guide-books and among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
these of a guide-book to Mexico, <i>eo nomine</i>, it had
been fitter and more worthy their own high standing
had they not stooped to palm off such a farrago upon
a man whose thoughts at the time were not how to
get to Mexico nor what could be seen if he went
there, but simply the means of beguiling an evening,
lolling at ease in his smoking jacket.</p>

<p>As to the lady who was once equal to writing <i>The
Land of the Sky</i>, one feels sorrow at her fall, and
cannot help wondering if sin of this sort yields her
either profit or pleasure.</p>

<p>2. If a reader were asked to single out some one
publisher whose name should be guarantee that in
buying a book one would get fair equivalent for his
money, not in paper and ink alone, but in the stuff
of its ideas, he would not often go amiss were he to
name Macmillans. It is with double pain therefore
that he resents being led astray into paying Two Dollars
for such a trifling effusion as <i>Love in Idleness</i>. He
is hurt not only by the one and one-half dollars lost
in excess of any just valuation of the book, but also
and perhaps by a less reparable loss of the confidence
long deserved by the class of Macmillan publications.
In short he feels that both publisher and writer have
conspired to cinch him and the rest of the reading
public, and here, too, the heavier share of the reproach
must fall upon the man. If Mr. Marion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Crawford, pluming himself upon such past achievements
as <i>Mr. Isaacs</i>, chooses to value the weakling
of his decadence at such extravagant figures that it
must be listed at Two Dollars if it is to appear in
decent type, there is surely no need that his accomplice
be Macmillan. Doubtless there be publishers
whose horns would be exalted were Crawford’s
name to shine upon their title pages, but Macmillan
is not of such cattle; he stands among the very topmost
already, wherefore he should be above impostures.</p>

<p>The book is freely illustrated, but the pictures
have nothing to do with the persons and incidents
of the story.</p>

<p>3. As the editor of the Only Real Sure-Enough
<i>Chip-Munk</i> so truthfully points out in his every issue,
man is an imitative animal. But whether it is equally
true that there are hundreds and hundreds of imitation
chip-munks, all made like those calico cats that
do duty as bric-a-brac, I cannot say. Yet the undisputed
statement, made in such a solemn way, that man
is imitative, must stand.</p>

<p>On ascending a certain beautiful little bay along
the coast of Maine, the traveller is confronted by the
startling legend, painted on the face of a great palisade:
<i>This is Belfast, the Home of Gringo’s Vermifuge—One
Hundred Doses for One Dollar</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>And to-day at Franklin, Ohio, as the train stops at
the water tank one sees in the pasture opposite, an
immense bill board, and on the board in gigantic letters
are the words: <i>This is Franklin, the Home of
Jingo’s Advice to Authors—One Hundred Places to
sell Manuscript, One Dollar</i>.</p>

<p>That a place is needed to sell manuscript I will
admit—in fact I am looking for such a place, but I
only require <i>one</i> place, not a hundred. So I am suspicious
of Mr. Jingo: I think that he offers just
ninety-nine times more than is meet, and so I turn to
Mr. Arthur Lewis of Albany, who has in the press a
book with a title suspiciously like the Ohio publication.
It is called <i>Advice to Literary Aspirants—One
Hundred Ways to Become Famous for One Dollar</i>.
Advance sheets of this work show that the author
has expended considerable care on it. He marshals
statistics to show that only one out of 97,621 of the
men who write books ever secure even a tuppence
worth of fame. In fact he proves that fame and
good writing have no more to do with each other
than Art and Truth, Virtue and Profession, Marriage
and Constancy. He therefore concludes that the
Literary Aspirant should secure his Fame first and
launch his Literature afterward, and in this way take
the tide at its flood and move on to fortune. To this
end the gifted author gives one hundred ways of securing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
fame. He starts with Homicide and runs
through to Arson and Bridge Jumping, giving incidentally
fourteen different kinds of Scandal and how
to bring it about.</p>

<p>In my own mind I have always made a distinction
between illustrious men, famous men and notorious
men, but Mr. Lewis avers that in our day and generation
such fine shades are all obliterated by the bright
iridescence of the standard dollar. An author, he
says, succeeds only as his books sell, and if his name
is on the lips of rumor, women especially will besiege
the stores and demand his tomes.</p>

<p>Now we must admit that the fine sophistry that Mr.
Lewis brings to bear is interesting, but is it Art?
Further than this, does it fill a vacuum in the great
economic cosmos of Letters? I do not think that it
does, and therefore do not hesitate to flatly give it
as my opinion that while the author is sincere,
the publishers are moved by no other motive than to
secure the money of ambitious young men and
women, having first victimized Mr. Lewis for the
cost of plates and the first edition. That the work,
like all skillful sophistry, is inspiring to the young,
there is no doubt, but the final effect of the book on
society I believe will be damaging, and therefore I
cannot conscientiously recommend it.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Our valued co-worker in the vineyard, the Rev.
George H. Hepworth, has begun to cast his
Sunday <i>Herald</i> sermons in the first person singular
and affix his distinguished name thereto. If this will
make these sermons no better it will at least make
them no worse.</p>

<p>As long-time admirers of these admirable Sabbath
sermocinations <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> welcomes this innovation.
And we think we know the wherefore of it.
The Rev. Mr. Hepworth’s name attached to an article
denunciatory of sin will have a tendency to strike
terror into the heart of Beelzebub, and it was for this
reason, no doubt, that Mr. Bennett directed Brother
Hepworth to take the field in person.</p>

<p>Unquestionably this will add a new and livelier
interest to the church. Each combatant knows
exactly whom he is fighting. It is now Hepworth
against Satan with a fair field and no favor. We
have no hesitancy in saying that so far as Mr. Hepworth
is concerned there will be no <i>Valkyrie</i> business.
Moreover there is no desire to shirk responsibility.
What he has to say he will say fearlessly over his
own signature, and if those against whom these ecclesiastical
thunderbolts are launched do not like them
they know what they can do. Wot t’ell!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak hanging allsmcap" id="SIDE_TALKS_WITH_THE_PHILISTINES">SIDE TALKS WITH THE PHILISTINES:
BEING SUNDRY BITS OF
WISDOM WHICH HAVE BEEN
HERETOFORE SECRETED, AND ARE NOW
SET FORTH IN PRINT.</h2>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> If <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> disturbs placid self-complacency
anywhere, as one or two of its critics intimate, it is
sorry, for there is no such happiness attainable anywhere
this side of Nirvana as its serene contemplation
of the charms of self which Narcissus and some
more modern fakirs exemplify; and the magazine of
to-day is its gospel. But so good a Philistine as
Horace Greeley is my authority for believing that the
still pool in which self-love sees the reflection it feeds
upon is a breeder of death, not life, and effervescence is
the sworn foe of the morbid. Not the things we do
that we ought not to do, but the things left undone
that we ought to do are the primary count leading
up to the confession that “there is no health in us.”
The other follows. Stagnation and the miasma of
self-consciousness co-exist and are not to be separated.
Wherefore, fellow-egoists, let us get a gait
on.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I like the broad flourish with which some imaginative
writers connect widely separated events in a
stroke of the pen and omit all that lies between as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
mere incident. It seems to me a proof of the theory
put forward by my good friend Elbert Hubbard that
genius is a feminine element of character—in man or
woman. For example, I find this statement in the
latest of the <i>Little Journeys</i>: “Moses was sent
adrift, but the tide carried him into power.” I didn’t
know just what that meant till I recalled the discovery
of the bulrush cradle. A less intuitive writer
wouldn’t have bridged eighty years in that summary
way. He might have hinted at Moses’s police court
record—told how he killed an Egyptian for calling
him a son of a Populist or something and skun out
for half a lifetime and yet became a Prince of Egypt
and spent forty years or so at court before he took
the road with the forefathers of Brickmaker Tourgee.
But to connect the condensed milk baby in the market
basket on the Nile with the law-giver of Israel in
one movement, as the music people say, is a pretty
long span and suggests the liberty David Copperfield
takes with his own biography in the best book but
one written by the subject of the latest <i>Little Journey</i>.
“I was born:” he says—and all else is irrelevant.
I take it that Mr. Hubbard agrees with John
Boyle O’Reilly that “the world was made when a
man was born.” The feminine element of genius
which Mr. Hubbard tells us makes poets is manifest
in that formula. If the author of the <i>Journeys</i> will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
permit, I would suggest that the same mother instinct
that crops out there is manifested in the grasp of a
life in the compass of a sentence which puzzled me at
the first. To be born and to die is the record of
existence, to which all else is tributary; and the
pangs of birth and death thrill all the poet-strains.
Only the tragedy that sweeps along the strings lives
to echo in human hearts. It is the deathless minor
chord that distinguishes the melody of true poetry
from the dancing cadences of rhyme in all literature.
The undertone is the soul of all song, in verse or in
the unmeasured periods of epic prose.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mention of Moses recalls the perhaps unique fact
that a priest of the most austere of churches rolled
off a tongue, musical with brogue, in his newspaper
sanctum—for he is a priest of the pen too—this romantic
version of the basket story which I have
never seen anywhere but in his paper—then in the
process of make-up:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On Egypt’s banks, convaynient to the Nile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Great Pharaoh’s daughter went to bathe in shtyle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And shtooping down, as everyone supposes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To scratch her shin, she shpied the infant Moses:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then turning to her maids, in accents wild</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I observe that the editor of the <i>Arena</i> is about to
make a contract with the Michigan Wheel Company<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
of Lansing, Michigan, for large quantities of its product
to give as prizes to new contributors only, the
old ones being already well supplied.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The following advertisement is clipped from one of
the October magazines:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Bohemian Publishing Co.</span>,<br />

</div>

<p>I have sent for this book, as it is my intention to
write one hundred manuscripts, and I desire to keep
track of them until published and paid for. I have
therefore ordered the book bound in cast iron.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In a recent number of <i>Modern Art</i> protest is filed
against the editor of the <i>Chip-Munk</i> continuing to
ask that startling question “Do You Keep a Dog?”
In God’s name, what right have the Chicago Decadents
to thus pry into our private affairs? Is it not
bad enough when the <i>Chip-Munk</i> advises us to drink
Guzzle’s beer and use Culby’s soap without being
interrogated as to what we “keep?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Among the revivals which occur now and then in
everything is a discussion of an old “science” of
reading characters by the hair. I don’t know much
about it, but from what I have heard I believe a pair
of old she-bears set back the theory for a few centuries
when they chewed up the small boys that
poked fun at Elijah. The old man would be rated
as having no character, according to these “readers,”
for he had no hair, but Providence and the early
Ursulines vindicated him.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A new woman who has been reading <i>God’s Fool</i>
laid it down at the last chapter with a long sigh.
“What do you think of it,” I asked. “It is dramatic,”
she said, “terribly dramatic at the end,”
and then added, after a pause, “I wonder what the
reading of the next generation will be like. We
have reached a force and directness of narration that
seems to me to be pretty near the limit of possibility.
What will we have next?” “What do you think?”
I asked. “I think,” she said, “we will have a reaction.
We will take in more and give out less.
We are near one of the great periods of what has
been called revelation in the past. Our literature is
shallow but perfect, relatively, in expression. Our
art is the same throughout. Our politics are personal.
Our religion is liberal, and loose in the joints. Our
social life is insincere and imitative. Our lives have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
nothing in them to stir the deeps. There will be a
reaction. The finesse of expression will be set aside
for the tremendous earnestness that accompanies great
events and prints their lessons on receptive minds.
A break-up in Europe it may be, or some other social
convulsion, that will change the tide. We are pretty
near at the top of the flood now.” That’s the new
woman’s view. I wonder how near she’s right?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Three hundred and twenty-seven thousand of my
friends have individually sent to me a recent number
of my Philadelphia contemporary, <i>Footlights</i>, in which
it refers to <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> variously as a crow, a
dicky bird and “a birdie of the jackass breed.” I
am glad to be catalogued in this ornithological manner,
and my friends may accept the listing as they
please. As for myself, I’d rather be a good honest
wild ass of the desert with long fuzzy ears than a poor
imitation bird-of-paradise—stuffed by one hundred
and seventeen geniuses.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A matter of architecture has been involved in the
social problem which the <i>Arena</i> has ever with it—like
a stutter or a beer breath. According to an alleged
novel recently published by the Arena Company
and called <i>Edith, a Story of Chinatown</i>, a feature
of the tabooed district of Los Angeles, California,
is a bay window projection on the houses devoted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
vice, wherein beauty spreads lures for the eyes of
passers-by. The heroine of this lovely romance is
one of these persons, sinned against in the prologue
and sinning in the present, but discovered by a miraculous
New York reporter on a vacation and returned
to her broken-hearted parents and a good life.
A benediction, with a remote hint of the Lohengrin
march, ends the story. The <i>Arena</i> gives two pages
to a review of the book, which is very kind of the
publisher, and tells us therein that a description of
Alameda street and of Dupont street, San Francisco,
which is worse, is its purpose. The <i>Arena</i> can be
depended on for a full stock of “terrible examples.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The <i>Literary Digest</i> is falling into line admirably.
Recently it printed a translation from some French
source from which I clip the following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A Parisian literary man has been complaining that
authors are not represented at international expositions
in the same sense as are painters and sculptors.
The complaint has provoked sarcastic comment from
M. Maurice Goncourt, who, in <i>Charivari</i> (Paris),
suggests that, since an exhibition of their works
would not be sufficiently striking, the authors themselves
should be put on show in cages!</p>

<p>“All the writers who are at present the incontestable
masters of romance and journalism will transport,
during the period of the Exposition, their working
rooms to a section specially provided for them.</p>

<p>“The public will see them there as they really are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
at home, surrounded with their furniture, their books,
all their accessories, and in working costume.</p>

<p>“From such an hour to such an hour—as at home—they
will work on their articles, poems, or novels.</p>

<p>“That would draw a crowd; that would be truly
interesting!</p>

<p>“They could be looked at through a sheet of glass
or a lattice—silently, so as not to interfere with their
inspiration.</p>

<p>“The administration could even put up signs like
this:</p>

<p class="center">PLEASE THROW NOTHING TO THE POETS,</p>

<p class="noindent">or—more particularly for the pretty visitors:</p>

<p class="center">DON’T EXCITE THE PSYCHOLOGISTS.</p>

</div>

<p>All this sounds much as though it had been written
by the keeper of <i>The Literary Shop</i>, but I don’t believe
it was. Supposing, however, such an exhibit
were held at Atlanta with the Fair now in progress.
Imagine Mr. Gilder and James Knapp Reeve, Mr.
Le Gallienne and Laura Jean Libbey, Count Tolstoi
and Mrs. Mary Jane Holmes, each in his or her own
coop like a Leghorn chicken! Imagine Colonel S.
S. McClure (Limited) with his Menagerie of Trained
Thoroughbreds, each one of them exhibiting by his
emaciation the horrible results of syndicate writing!
Imagine Cy Warman pawing madly at the bars of his
cage trying to tell Sweet Marie about the secret in
his heart! Then imagine Little Tin God of Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
cuddled up in his basket, writing his masterpiece,
<i>How to Feed a Sick Kitten!</i> To them then
would enter Major John Boyd Thacher, the pride and
joy of the Albany Democracy, and judge equally both
the just and the unjust. It’s a great idea.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> One of my correspondents tells me that “the editor
of the <i>Lark</i> uses execrable perfume on his note
paper.” This item is for the future reference of Mr.
Burgess when he writes about his literary passions.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Several solemn newspapers have taken seriously to
the extent of half a column or so the proposal of a
San Francisco publishing house to “bring out good
literature in a cheap form,” which sounds much like
the advance agent talk of most publishing houses. It
isn’t a joke, to be sure, but a good deal depends on
what is meant by “good literature.” Thundering
in the prologue is not a novelty, but there may be a
storm coming for all that.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I note that the brilliant Bok has gone to writing
proverbs. Here is one culled at random from “A
Handful of Laconics,” printed under his honored signature
in his September output:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is singular and yet a fact that what we are most
loath to believe possessed by others is what we are
incapable of ourselves.</p>

</div>

<p>It is my wish to call the particular attention of my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
readers to this nugget. From a literary and philosophic
standpoint literature contains nothing like it.
Examine Rochefoucauld, Montaigne, Plutarch, Pliny
the Elder, Pliny the Younger or Solomon, and you
will not find its fellow. Read it again, and read it
slowly: “It-is-singular-yet-a-fact-that-what-we-are-most-loath-to-believe-possessed-by-others-is-what-we-are-incapable-of-ourselves.”
This is undoubtedly the
finest thing in the language and a reward of one
million dollars will be paid to any <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> who
will furnish the solution. There is no bar against
reading it backwards. It reads a little better backwards
than forwards, but I do not think that is it.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I desire to record a discovery. I found a magazine
the other day with the advertising pages uncut.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I doubt if Bliss Carman has had a more enthusiastic
admirer than I. When his <i>Vagabondia</i> appeared I
sent a copy to Her, which was the greatest compliment
I could pay the book. In the magazines, notably
in <i>Town Topics</i>, he has printed verses that were
well worth preserving as some of the best of the
decade. In the great mass, however, which he has
published, there have been lines which nobody on
earth could understand. They were worse than
Stephen Crane’s, for he at least has a vague idea
somewhere, though he rarely does us the favor to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
express it in a seemly manner. Now I want to protest,
not only against Mr. Carman, but against <i>Life</i>,
which gave us <i>The Whale and the Sprat</i> which Mr.
Carman wrote recently. Here are two of the stanzas:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">My dear Mr. Sprat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I really am grat-</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Ified at your offer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So down they both sat.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Said the Sprat to the Whale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I admire your tail;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I should think it would be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of great use in a gale.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>How Mr. Metcalfe ever allowed such drivel to get
into his columns I cannot understand. Possibly
while he was in Japan the compositor set the stuff in
the waste basket instead of that on the copy hook.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>Vogue</i> asserts that “thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s
wife” is the ninth commandment. On information
and belief, no doubt.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Because Mr. Rockefeller sneers at Mr. Pullman
for giving but a paltry hundred thousand for a church
at Albion, Orleans County, New York, Mr. Pullman
retorts that Rockefeller is only a malmsey-nosed
varlet anyway, whose grease his axles are not worthy
to unloose. I am not quite ready to take George M.
into the Philistinic fold, but he is surely coming my
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I rejoice to find a thoughtful article by Richard
Burton on the “Renascence of Old English Expression”
in the current <i>Forum</i>—and not so much for what
is in the article in detail as for its recognition of the
main fact that there is something besides Bunthornism
in the harking back to the simple dignity of early
English. Our author, it will be noted, has little use
for the overflowing maimed vowels of Normanesque
“Renaissance.” Plain Latin renascence is good
enough in a plea for the Saxon. But it is odd if so
simple a thing as a rising from death into new life
has no Saxon equivalent. Why not “re birth!”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Since the Mule-Spinners at Cohoes and Fall River
went out on a strike I understand that subscriptions
to <i>The Writer</i> have fallen off one-third.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Neith Boyce is a poet who never beats the brush
piles of thought without starting good game. She
writes good honest verse and she also writes “Book
Notes and News” and other things for the <i>New
Cycle</i>. The <i>New Cycle</i>, by the way, is not published
by the Pope Manufacturing Company as one might
suppose, but it is a monthly magazine “devoted to
Education, Social Economics, Literature and Art.” I
once edited a magazine devoted to Education, but the
subject proved too large for the brainful syndicate
that employed me; I have also written a book on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Art; and once, having nothing to do, I lectured for a
space on Social Economics, but God help me! I
never in a small monthly magazine attempted to tell
all about Education, Social Economics, Literature
<i>and</i> Art.</p>

<p>But the <i>New Cycle</i> is interesting, and if its various
departments were as well cared for as its Book Notes
and News it would be a greater success than it is.
Neith Boyce has an unfailing insight and her touch is
as light and as sure as my own; and moreover
there is a tang to her wit that all bookish Philistines
might well cultivate. In classic lore I have
always looked up to Miss Boyce as the Court of last
Appeal, but is it not possible that Minerva sometimes
nods? Read this:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“An attraction of the eminently respectable <i>Harper’s
Weekly</i> will be a series of papers called ‘A
Houseboat on the Styx’ by Mr. Bangs of Yonkers.
Nothing is sacred to this funny man. Not content
with taking his fling at the defunct majesty of Napoleon
he now proposes to take Pluto by the beard
and make copy of the pale shadows that throng the
Stygian shores.”</p>
</div>

<p>It may be so, but I did not know that Pluto had
whiskers. And how does Miss Boyce dispose of the
legend concerning the smooth face and giddy ways
of old Mr. Pluto when he took to wife the young and
blooming Persephone? Charon wears a Vandyke as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
we well know; while Mephisto is usually represented
as clean-shaved or at best a moustache and goatee;
but hereafter I’ll never think of Pluto without calling
up in mind Mr. Peffer of Kansas. Go to, Fair
Lady! think you because barber shops are closed in
York State on Sundays that they are shut in Hades
all the week? Next!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A lecturer on Egypt, telling the natives of Buffalo,
N. Y., about the marvels in stone built on that strip
of mud, illustrated the proportions of the Nile Valley
by saying “It it eleven hundred miles long in Egypt
proper and seven miles wide for most of its length.
If the city of Buffalo were laid crosswise in the
valley, it would bisect the kingdom.” And a Rochester
man who had strayed into the fold was mean
enough to add: “And if Buffalo was there, that’s
the way it would lie—cross-ways.” That’s the way
they talk in Rochester.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I quote this paragraph from <i>Alice</i> and respectfully
refer it to the editor of <i>Mlle New York</i> with the hope
that he can see the point as plainly as he sees most
things:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>All this time the Guard was looking at her, first
through a telescope, then through a microscope, and
then through an opera glass. At last he said,
“You’re travelling the wrong way,” and shut up the
window and went away.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> On his way to Montreal Mr. Hall Caine stopped
off one day at East Aurora. The Pink Tea given in
his honor at the office of <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> was largely
attended by the farmers from both up the creek and
down the creek. In fact, as my old friend Billy McGlory
used to say, “Ye cudden’t see de street fer
dust.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Boston <i>Commonwealth</i> (what satire there is in
that name!) is a nice paper, but its editor has not
smiled for forty years; and all of his little writers
carry so much culture that they are round-shouldered,
flat-chested, bow-legged and near-sighted.
They belong to the large class that invariably miss
the point of things and use dignity for a mask to hide
their lack of a sense of fun. The <i>Commonwealth</i> accuses
us of being envious of the <i>Chip-Munk</i>; of
being violently prejudiced against Mr. Cudahy’s
book, and of speaking irreverently of Boston. Go to
thou old granny <i>Commonwealth</i>, why sit you like your
grandsire carved in alabaster and creep into the
jaundice by being peevish?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The <i>Book-Peddler</i> is doing great service in promotion
of what passes for literature in the paper and
ink stores. I cannot but think what a similar publication
devoted to literature, not trade, could do to
save the valuable time of the reading public. Since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Solomon’s time a good many things have changed,
but in one there is no improvement. “Of the making
of many books there is no end,” and that is a
heap sadder than the lamentation of Maud Muller
and His Honor.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Concerning Mr. Grant Allen’s book and the manner
in which its title has been made the basis of several
others more or less reminiscent, my most valued
correspondent writes me that the novelists are missing
much by not calling a story <i>The Woman Who Is
Simply Dying To</i>. In my well known philanthropic
way I throw out this suggestion hoping that somebody
may make many dollars by the adoption of the
title for a decadent tale.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Vanastorbilts are really under great obligations
to Mrs. Rorer’s <i>Household News</i> for the simple daily
menus for poor folks which are a feature. There’s
nothing so cheap as good living—in a magazine.
When bread sticks and banana chutney and peaches
and rice and cantaloupe can be mowed away
by a poor man before the seven o’clock whistle blows
no hard worker ought to lack muscle for his daily
toil. We have printed assurance of Mrs. Bellow
that “These menus have been arranged on a scientific
plan, are thoroughly hygienic, and contain all
that is necessary for proper living.” It is luck after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
all that man does not live by bread alone, but by
every word that proceedeth out of the hygienic mouth
aforesaid.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Messrs. Lo &amp; Behold, publishers of works on moral
pathology, Boston, are making great efforts to club
the <i>Arena</i>. I understand they propose offering season
tickets to museums of morbid anatomy as prizes.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I note a somewhat guarded statement by Dr. Swan
M. Burnett denying that he and his wife have separated
or are undergoing that mutually humiliating
process. All there is of it, he says, is that her work
keeps her abroad and his keeps him in Washington.
The doctor’s friends say, however, that the doctor
and the writist live apart and have done so for years
and that he is tired of being referred to as Mrs. Frances
Hodgson Burnett’s husband. I think more likely
he objects to being identified at the banks and elsewhere
as the father of Little Lord Fauntleroy.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The <i>Pell Mell Gazette</i> of last Saturday contains a
cablegram from Mr. Hall Caine, dated at East Aurora,
N. Y., wherein the author of <i>The Manxman</i>
reports that the prospect for next year’s crop of ginger
is very promising.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I suppose it’s all right for the publisher of <i>Munsey’s</i>
to tell how he made that magazine jump from 20,000
to half a million copies a month by shutting out middlemen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
and reaching the hungering and thirsting
public direct. That’s his cue. If the publisher
didn’t blow his horn who would? I opine, however,
that the fish would sell without it, and that the editor
of <i>Munsey’s</i> could tell them something a good deal
more interesting in the same space. What does the
great public, with its multitude of aims and desires,
care how such an effect was accomplished? All that
could safely remain within the veil. It would be
more to the point if the editor or publisher of Mr.
Bok’s collection of wax works would tell by what
miracle he got a circulation. It is easy in the other
case, regardless of the smart publisher. The time
passed long ago when a horse being led to water
could be forced to drink. The public must have
wanted <i>Munsey’s</i> when it was shut out by the middleman
or they wouldn’t have compelled the dealers
to send for it, and that implies that there’s something
in it besides self-consciousness and the publisher’s
tactical brilliancy. But how on earth came the embodied
ego and its sisters and cousins and aunts to
get a hearing anywhere? Is Ruth Ashmore, <i>alias</i>
Bab, at the bottom of it?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A certain gentleman of my acquaintance, having
heard until he is sick of it that it takes nine Taylors
to make a man, continues to boldly assert that it
takes two Chatfields to make a Taylor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> When the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> was started six months ago
I had no idea that it would now have half a million
subscribers.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I am reminded by a Boston newspaper of the continued
existence of a belief that criticism of books
and other things more or less remotely connected
with literature is largely a matter of prejudice and
that the imprints on title pages determine the authors’
fate. Yet the same article goes on to quote the
<i>Chip-Munk</i> firm as proof that merit will win sometimes
in spite of such drawbacks. It seems to me
the instance proves too much.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> And here, just at the last, I want to set down what
I have just read in a delightful book written by Katherine
Cheever Meredith—Johanna Staats—because it
seems to fit one’s mood at this time of year. This
is it:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Oh, I play with Miss Gray Blanket and I play
with Fanny.”</p>

<p>“Fanny? The little girl?”</p>

<p>“Yes. After it’s dark, you know, I play with
her. Then I talk to her. She never answers. But
I play she’s so tired she can’t. Of course I can’t
play <i>that</i> when it’s light. For then I could <i>see</i> that
she wasn’t there. But in the dark she <i>might</i> be.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” responded Poole abstractedly. He
was thinking that many men and women indulge in
the same game. Sometimes with their faith in each
other; but more often, though, with their creeds.</p>

<p class="dropcap">It was one of those November days when the
wind swoops down the mountain sides, bringing
an avalanche of leaves—disked oak leaves—and
then leaving them for a moment in the valley basin,
gathers them in her mighty hands and tosses them
again almost to the mountain tops.</p>

<p>Chris found a sympathy in the dizzy, whirling,
swirling leaves. His hopes had withered so, and
now a girl’s changeful hand had been as reckless
with him as was the wind with these: like wrath in
death and envy afterwards.</p>

<p>Poor Chris’s spiritual kingdom was suffering the
nature of an insurrection, for though he loved her he
was too proud to tell her she had misjudged him.
The dissipation of his hopes now was tinged with
regret, just as the wanton winds seem to us ruthless
as we remember when these leaves were planes and
green, not disked and brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Mockingly came the dance of leaves around his
feet—each like a thing alive—to beckon him here,
there, to elude him, to laugh at him.</p>

<p>“It’s too hard to bear!” groaned Chris, between
his teeth. “How could she believe it! How could
she!”</p>

<p>A flurry of hurrying, scurrying leaves swept past
him, a company of mocking, dancing leaves; from
right and left they came, and scarce ten steps before
him they met and swirled up—up into a monstrous
wraith with beckoning hands. Chris’s conflict took
form. “I’ll do it! I’ll do it! I’ll show her!
She’ll regret this day!” and he threw back his head
and with flashing eyes started forward with resolute
steps.</p>

<p>A lost leaf wavered, dipped, paused, then with a
timid wafture touched his crisp curls.</p>

<p>His blood surged up, for it was like the caress of a
loving hand.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Chris, “I may be wrong—I’ll tell
her so;” and holding the lost leaf very gently between
his two hands he walked swiftly back.</p>
